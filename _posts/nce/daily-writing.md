#### 1. dog veiw

 I am a dog, My name is Rex.I used to live in a big house with a large garden.I liked to sit outside the front and bark.everytime I wanted to come into the garden I would bark until someone opened the gate.  As the neighbours complained about my barks. My master spent weeks training me to press my paw on the latch to let myself in.I am very smart, I soon became an expert at opening the gate.but comparing opening the gate, I prefer to bark for someone to open the gate.so I found another way to do it.as soon as I opens the gate, I comes into the garden and waits until the gate shuts. Then I sits and barks until someone lets me outside, after this I immediately  lets myself in and begins barking again.this gave me a great deal of pleasure.but soon my master's wife found my secret, when she went outside shoping last week.she told this to my master, and then my master removed the gate.I got very anonyed, everytime I barked, no one would open the gate.I was very dissatifeid and left the big house and never come back.

#### 2. Neighbours view

Our neighbour, Max,  raised a dog years ago, it was call Rex, Rex used to sit outside the front gate and bark, evertime he wanted to come into the garden he would bark until someone opened the gate, even in the middlenight, I complained of the noisy many times to Max, he gave me a promise that he would sovle this. he spent weeks teaching Rex to open the gate by pressing his paw on the latch. Rex was a smart dog,  he soon became an expert at opening the gate.However when I went by the Max's house last week. I noticed that Rex was barking again, this time he was in the garden and waiting someone to let  him outside!  I immidately told Max about it. Max got anoyed , he removed the gate.  Rex could never bark for someone to open the gate. Rex got anoyed, since then I have never seen Rex.

## Lesson 60
foretell

#### fortune-teller view
I am a fortune-teller, people call me Madam Bellinsky. I set up a tent in a village fair to make money.
yesterday a man visited me, he came into my tent and I told him to sit down. after he had put some money in my bowl, I looked into a crystal ball and tell him that a relative of his was coming to see him, she would be arriving this eveing and intends to stay for a few days. the moment he went outside, a beautifull woman he knows well  would rush toward him, she would speak to him and lead him out of this plase, that is all I said to him.

as soon as he went outside, I totally forgot him and what I said. the following morning, he returned to my tent and told me all I had foretold correctly, as soon as he went outside, his wife hurried towards to him and asked him where he had been hiding, she had been looking for him all the afternoon, she told him that his sister would be here in less than an hour, they had to be at the station to meet her. they were late already. as she walked away, he followed her out of the fare.

#### writer's wife view
my husband believes that fortune can be known by fortune-teller. a few days ago he visited a fortune-teller called Madam Bellinsky at a village fair. he went into the tent. it was dark inside. the fortune-teller told him to sit down, after he had given her some money, she asked him to keep queit while she was working,then she looked into a crystal ball and said: a relative of yours is comming to see you, she will be arriving this eveninng. she intends to stay for a few days. the moment you leave this tent, a woman you know well will rush toward you and speak to you. She will lead you out of this place. that is all.  as soon as he went outside, he forgot all about Madam Bellinsky because I hurried towards to him, I had been looking for him for all the afternoon."where have you been hiding" I asked impationtly. 'your sister will be here in less than an hour, we must be at the station to meet her. we are late already'. as I walked away, he followed me out of the fair.
