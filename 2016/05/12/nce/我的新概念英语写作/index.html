<h2 id="Lesson-64"><a href="#Lesson-64" class="headerlink" title="Lesson 64"></a>Lesson 64</h2><p>Aime’s view</p>
<p>I am Aime from french. I am engneer. in 1858, I arrived in England. I had a plan for a twenty-one miles tunnel under the English Channel. in this plan a platform was possible to build in the center of the tunnel. it would serve as a port and railway station. the tall chimneys would be built above the sea level to make the tunnel well-ventilated. but the british thought my plas was not good enough. two year later, a better plan was put forwardd by an Englishman, Williams Low. He said a double railway shoud be built. it would sovle the problem of ventilation. for when a train enterd the tunnel. it would draw in fresh air behind it. though the plan was perfect, the tunnel was actually begun forty two years later. soon it was stoped, for the war began, the british feard the invasion. until I died I could not see the tunnel was begun again.</p>
<p>William’s View.</p>
<p>The Engish Channel is twenty-tow miles from Britain to French. It was possible to build a tunnel under it. recenlty  a French engneer called Aime came to English with a plan for the tunnel. He suggested that it would be possible to build a platform in the centre of the Channel. Tall chemneys above the sea level would be built to sovle the problems of the ventilation. but the british did not agree the plan, for it is not posibble to build a lot of chimneys above the sea. Based on Aime’s plan, I designed another plan. in my plan I suggested that we should built a double railways. it would  make the tunnel well-ventilated. because the trains would bring fresh air into the tunnel when it entered the tunnnel. but they refused my plan neither. forty-two years later a tunnel was begun, if the warfare had not begun and the british had not been afraid of the invasion, it would have been completed and conneted Britain and the European continent.</p>
<h2 id="lesson-66"><a href="#lesson-66" class="headerlink" title="lesson 66"></a>lesson 66</h2><p>twenty-six years ago, a Lancaster bomber crashed on Wallis island in the south Pacific, the island is remote and a long way west of Samoa.<br>but over the years. the crash was forgotten and the wreck remained undisturbed. but the plane was accidentally rediscovered in an aerial survey of the island. By this time, a Lancaster bomber in reasonalbe condition was rare and worth rescueing. The French authorities had the plane packaged and moved in parts back to France. a group of enthusiasts are going to have the plane restored, it has four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines, but the group will need to have only three of them rebuilt. Imagine thier suprise and delight when they broke open the packing cases, the fourth engine was sweet as honey– still in perfect condition, a colony of bees had turned the engine into a hive and it was tottaly preserved in beeswax.</p>
